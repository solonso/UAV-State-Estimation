# UAV-State-Estimation

## Overview
Welcome to **UAV-State-Estimation**, a comprehensive Python repository for 3D state estimation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using Kalman Filter techniques. This repository offers a unique blend of theoretical models and practical simulations, perfect for enthusiasts and professionals in the field of drone technology and autonomous systems.

## Features
- **3D Kalman Filter Tracking:** Utilizing the `KalmanFilterModel` class from `kftracker3d.py`, the repository implements a robust Kalman Filter for accurate state estimation in three dimensions.
- **Drone Dynamics Model:** The `DroneModel3D` class in `drone_model_3d.py` simulates the physical behavior of a UAV, incorporating key dynamics like position, velocity, and orientation.
- **Interactive Simulations:** `drone_tracker3d.py` provides tools for running simulations and visualizing the results in a dynamic and informative manner.
- **Extensible Framework:** The base class `KalmanFilterBase` in `kfmodels.py` lays the foundation for future extensions and customizations of the Kalman Filter.
- **Comprehensive Simulation Control:** `kalman_main.py` serves as the entry point for the simulation, offering various parameters for customizing the UAV's motion and sensor characteristics.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation:** Clone the repository and ensure you have all required dependencies, such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, installed.
2. **Running a Simulation:** Execute `kalman_main.py` to start a simulation. You can modify the simulation options within this script to suit your experimental needs.
3. **Visualization:** Observe the performance of the Kalman Filter in real-time through the plots generated during the simulation.

## Usage Examples
- **State Estimation in Noisy Environments:** Demonstrate how the Kalman Filter maintains accurate state estimates despite measurement noise.
- **Motion Pattern Analysis:** Explore how different UAV motion patterns affect the performance of the state estimator.
- **Sensor Fusion:** Extend the framework to incorporate multiple sensors for more robust state estimation.
